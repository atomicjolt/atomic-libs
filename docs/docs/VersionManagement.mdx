# Version Management

This repo uses [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/tree/main) for managing versions. To publish a new version of a package, follow these steps:

### Create a new changeset

Each time that you make meaningful changes to a package, you should create a new changeset. To do this, run the following command:
```bash
npx changeset
```

This will guide you through the process of creating a new changeset.

Once you have created a changeset, you can view it by running the following command:
```bash
npx changeset status
```

### Version

To publish a new version of a package, run the following command:

```bash
npx changeset version
```
This will consume all of the changesets that have been created and bump the versions of the packages accordingly.
Additionally, it will write changelog entries for each package.

### Publish

To publish the new versions of the packages, run the following command:

```bash
npx changeset publish
```

This will loop through all of the packages and publish any that have a newer version than what is on NPM.
