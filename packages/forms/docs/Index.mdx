# Introduction

`@atomicjolt/forms` is a package that provides a set of React hooks and components to help manage form state and validation.

At it's core the library is a wrapper / integration of [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
and `@atomicjolt/atomic-elements`. It exposes form components that wrap Atomic Elements components and
integrates them with react-hook-form. You are then able to build your own custom form components just as you would
with react-hook-form.


# Installation

```bash
npm install @atomicjolt/forms
```

# Usage

```tsx
import { Form } from '@atomicjolt/forms';
import { Button } from '@atomicjolt/atomic-elements';

const MyForm = () => {
   const onSubmit = (data) => {
     console.log(data);
     // { firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe", age: 21 }
   }

   return (
      <Form onSubmit={onSubmit}>
         <Form.TextInput name="firstName" label="First Name" />
         <Form.TextInput name="lastName" label="Last Name" />
         <Form.NumberInput name="age" label="Age" />
         <Button type="submit">Submit</Button>
      </Form>
   )
};
```
