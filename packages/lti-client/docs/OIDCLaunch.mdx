# LTI Launch with Platform Storage

This package implements support for the [LTI 1.3 OIDC launch flow using client-side storage for state management](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/lti-cs-oidc/v0p1)

## On Initialization

During the initialization phase, you can call the `initOIDCLaunch` function to set up the necessary parameters for the OIDC launch:

```typescript
import { initOIDCLaunch } from "@atomicjolt/lti-client";

const initSettings = {
  state: "unique-state-string",
  responseUrl: "https://your-app.com/launch",
  ltiStorageParams: {
    platformOIDCUrl: "https://platform.com/auth",
  },
  relaunchInitUrl: "https://your-app.com/init",
  openIdCookiePrefix: "lti-launch",
};

await initOIDCLaunch(initSettings);
```

This function will

- Check if it needs to write to platform storage
- Writing the state to platform storage if it is supported
- Sending the user agent back to the platform for next steps in the OIDC flow

## On Launch

Once the LTI launch is completed, you can verify the state and handle the launch using the `ltiLaunch` function:

```typescript
import { ltiLaunch } from "@atomicjolt/lti-client";

const handleLaunch = async () => {
  const verified = await ltiLaunch({
    state: "your-state",
    ltiStorageParams: {
      platformOIDCUrl: "https://platform.com/auth",
    },
  });

  if (verified) {
    // Let the user access the application
    console.log("Launch verified and processed.");
  } else {
    // Show the user an error message
    console.error("Launch verification failed.");
  }
};
```
