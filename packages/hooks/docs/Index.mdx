# Introduction

`@atomicjolt/hooks` is a collection of React hooks that can be used to simplify common tasks in React applications.
The hooks are designed to be simple to use and easy to understand. The hooks are also designed to be composable,
so you can use them together to create more complex behavior.

## Installation

To install `@atomicjolt/hooks` run the following command:

```bash
npm install @atomicjolt/hooks
```

or

```bash
yarn add @atomicjolt/hooks
```

## Usage

To use a hook, import it from `@atomicjolt/hooks` and call it in your component.

```tsx
import { useDefaultState } from '@atomicjolt/hooks';

function MyComponent() {
  const [state, setState, revert] = useDefaultState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>State: {state}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setState(5)}>Set state to 5</button>
      <button onClick={revert}>Revert state</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
