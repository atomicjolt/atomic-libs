# Canvas Authentication

## CanvasAuthenticationForm

A component for handling Canvas LMS authentication.

```tsx
import { CanvasAuthenticationForm } from "@atomicjolt/canvas-client";

function App() {
  return (
    <CanvasAuthenticationForm
      action="/oauth/callback"
      settings={{ client_id: "12345" }}
      autoSubmit
    />
  );
}
```

### Props

The `CanvasAuthenticationForm` component accepts the following props:

- `action: string` - URL to submit the form to
- `settings?: Record<string, any>` - Additional settings to include as hidden input fields
- `autoSubmit?: boolean` - Whether to auto-submit the form on render (default: false)
- `children?: ReactNode` - Children elements to include in the form

The component also accepts all standard HTML form attributes.

### Custom Prompt

If you'd like to provide a custom prompt before the user is redirected to the authentication page, you need to handle submission yourself

```tsx
import { CanvasAuthenticationForm } from "@atomicjolt/canvas-client";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Custom Authentication</h1>
      <p>
        Please click the button below to authenticate this app to work with
        Canvas
      </p>
      <CanvasAuthenticationForm action="/oauth/callback">
        <button type="submit">Authenticate</button>
      </CanvasAuthenticationForm>
    </div>
  );
}
```
