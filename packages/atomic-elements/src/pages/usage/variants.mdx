## Variants

Some components in Atomic Elements have what we call _variants_.
A component variant is a preset configuration of a component that changes it's appearance or behavior in some way. There are two types of variants:

- **Visual Variants** only modify the visual presentation for a component via CSS. These can be easily modified / additional ones may be added.
- **Semantic Variants** modify the actual structure of a component's markup. These need to be added to the code explicitly. Note that any component that
  has semantic variants can also have visual variants

## Visual Variants

Visual variants are variants that only modify the visual appearance of a component. For example, the button component has several visual variants built-in that you can use:

<div style={{ display: "flex", gap: "10px" }}>
  <Button variant="primary">Primary</Button>
  <Button variant="secondary">Secondary</Button>
  <Button variant="success">Success!</Button>
  <Button variant="error">Error!</Button>
  <Button variant="border">Border</Button>
  <Button variant="link">Link</Button>
  <Button variant="ghost">Ghost</Button>
  <Button variant="inverted">Inverted</Button>
  <Button variant="content">Content</Button>
</div>

Visual variants are easy to create, you just need to add a new CSS declaration that targets the new classname.
For example, if you wanted to create a new variant called "purple" for the button component, you could do it like this:

```css
.aje-btn--purple {
  --btn-bg-clr: purple;
  --btn-text-clr: white;
  --btn-hover-bg-clr: rgb(179, 13, 179);
  --btn-hover-text-clr: white;
}
```

And then, you can use it like this:

```jsx
<Button variant="purple">Purple!</Button>
```

<Button variant="purple">Purple!</Button>

#### Modify Built in Variants

You can also modify the built-in variants if you want different defaults, but you need to be aware of CSS specificity rules to get it to work properly. By default,
the selector that applies the styles to each of the variants has higher specificity than just `.aje-btn--primary` for example. So, one easy way you could get around this
is by adding an id to your selector (like the ID of the root of your React app), for example:

```css
/* This won't override the built in styles */
.aje-btn--primary {
  --btn-bg-clr: blue;
  --btn-text-clr: white;
  --btn-hover-bg-clr: rgb(179, 13, 179);
  --btn-hover-text-clr: white;
}

/* This will */
#root .aje-btn--primary {
  --btn-bg-clr: blue;
  --btn-text-clr: white;
  --btn-hover-bg-clr: rgb(179, 13, 179);
  --btn-hover-text-clr: white;
}
```

## Semantic Variants

Semantic variants change the actual structure of the HTML, and as such, are implmented in the component specifically. For example, the "floating" variant
of the text input component moves the label _below_ the input rather than above it, you can see this by inspecting the following elements:

<TextInput variant="default" label="Default Variant" />
<br />
<TextInput variant="floating" label="Floating Variant" />

If you're interested in adding a new semantic variant to a component, you can look at the source code for the `TextInput` component to see how it's done.

The following components have semantic variants built in:

- `TextInput`
- `NumberInput`
- `SearchInput`
- `CustomSelect`
- `ComboBox`
