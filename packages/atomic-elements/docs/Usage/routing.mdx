# Routing

<CssVariables />

Several components in Atomic Elements support being rendered as an anchor tag.
This allows you to use the component as a link. When rendered as a link, each component supports the same props as an anchor tag such
as `href`, `target`, and `rel`.

By deafult, links perform native browser navigation. However, if your application supports client-side routing, you can
use the `RouterProvider` component to integrate with your routing library of choice.
Note that links to external sites or links with any other value for target except `target="_self"` attribute will always perform native browser navigation.

## Example

For example, the `Button` component can be rendered as an anchor tag by setting the `href` props.

```jsx
import { Button } from "@atomicjolt/atomic-elements";

<Button href="https://atomicjolt.com">Atomic Jolt</Button>;
```

The `Button` component will render as an anchor tag with the `href` attribute set to `https://atomicjolt.com`.

<Button href="https://atomicjolt.com">Atomic Jolt</Button>

<br />

## `RouterProvider`

The `RouterProvider` component allows you to integrate Atomic Elements with your client-side routing library of choice.

```jsx
import { RouterProvider } from "@atomicjolt/atomic-elements";
import { useNavigate, useHref } from "your-router";

function App() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  return (
    <RouterProvider navigate={navigate} useHref={useHref}>
      {/* ... */}
    </RouterProvider>
  );
}
```
