# Using Storybook

<a href="https://atomicjolt.github.io/atomic-libs/storybook/" target="_blank">Storybook Site</a>

Storybook is a tool for UI development. It makes development faster and easier by isolating components.
This allows you to work on one component at a time. You can develop entire UIs without needing to start up
a complex dev stack, force certain data into your database, or navigate around your application.

## Hiearchy

Storybook is organized into components. Each component is made up of documentation and one or more stories.

## Controls

Controls are ways that you can interact with your component.

  height="600"
  width="100%"
  loop
  autoPlay
/>

Reference the [Storybook docs on how to develop controls](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/controls)

## Actions

Actions are used to observe data emitted by event handlers in components.
