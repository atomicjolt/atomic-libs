# Routing

<ElementsProvider />

Several components in Atomic Elements support being rendered as an anchor tag.
This allows you to use the component as a link. When rendered as a link, each component supports the same props as an anchor tag such
as `href`, `target`, and `rel`.

## Example

The `Button` component can be rendered as an anchor tag by setting the `href` props.

<Example>
  <Example.Rendered>
    <Button href="https://atomicjolt.com" target="_blank">Atomic Jolt</Button>
  </Example.Rendered>
  <Example.Code>
    ```jsx
    <Button href="https://atomicjolt.com" target="_blank">
      Atomic Jolt
    </Button>
    ```
  </Example.Code>
</Example>

The `Button` component will render as an anchor tag with the `href` attribute set to `https://atomicjolt.com`.

## Client Side Routing

By default, links perform native browser navigation. However, if your application supports client-side routing, you can
use the `RouterProvider` component to integrate with your routing library of choice.

Note that links to external sites or links with any other value for target except `target="_self"` attribute will always perform native browser navigation.

<Example>
  <Example.Code>
    ```jsx
    import { RouterProvider } from "@atomicjolt/atomic-elements";
    import { useNavigate, useHref } from "your-router";

    function App() {
      const navigate = useNavigate();

      return (
        <RouterProvider navigate={navigate} useHref={useHref}>
          {/* ... */}
        </RouterProvider>
      );
    }
    ```
  </Example.Code>
</Example>
