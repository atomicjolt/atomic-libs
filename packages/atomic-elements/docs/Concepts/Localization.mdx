# Localization

Atomic Elements components are designed to work with multiple languages and locales. The components are built to be easily localized, and we provide a number of tools to help you do so.

Several components handle the details of localization for you. For instance:
- The `DatePicker` component will automatically localize the month and day names
- The `NumberInput` component will automatically localize the decimal and thousands separators.

:::note

Localization support for components is currently in-progress. If you need better support for localization in a component please [open an issue](https://github.com/atomicjolt/atomic-libs/issues/new)

## Customizing the Locale

By default, the locale is determined by the user's browser settings. You can override this by wrapping your component in a `LocaleProvider` and setting the `locale` prop.

```jsx
import { LocaleProvider } from "@atomicjolt/atomic-elements";

<LocaleProvider locale="en">{/* Your app here */}</LocaleProvider>;
```
