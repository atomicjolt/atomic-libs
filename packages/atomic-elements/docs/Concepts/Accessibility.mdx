## Aria Announcements

Atomic Elements implementation of live announcements is mostly implemented to be compatible with: [react-aria-live](https://github.com/AlmeroSteyn/react-aria-live) which we used previously.

### `LiveAnnouncer`

The `LiveAnnouncer` components provides a context to the rest of your application to announce messages to screen readers. It is used in conjunction with the `useAnnouncer` hook.

```jsx
import { LiveAnnouncer, useAnnouncer } from "@atomicjolt/atomic-elements";

function Example() {
  const { announcePolite } = useAnnouncer();

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => announcePolite("Hello World")}>
        Announce Hello World
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

function App() {
  return (
    <LiveAnnouncer>
      <Example />
    </LiveAnnouncer>
  );
}
```

### `withAnnouncer`

The `withAnnouncer` HOC provides a way to access the context of the `LiveAnnouncer` component in a class component.

```jsx
import { withAnnouncer } from "@atomicjolt/atomic-elements";

class Example extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const { announcePolite } = this.props;

    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={() => announcePolite("Hello World")}>
          Announce Hello World
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default withAnnouncer(Example);
```

### `LiveMessage`

The `LiveMessage` component will announce it's `message` prop to screen readers when it is rendered.

```jsx
import { LiveMessage } from "@atomicjolt/atomic-elements";

function Example() {
  return <LiveMessage message="Hello World" />;
}
```

> **Note**: The `LiveMessage` component is mostly just for compatabiltiy with the for mentioned package. It is recommended to use the `useAnnouncer` hook instead.
