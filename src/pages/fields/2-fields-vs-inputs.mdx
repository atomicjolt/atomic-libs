# Fields vs Inputs

You may have noticed that we have two components for text fields: `TextField` and `TextInput` that look very similar. This true, but they have different use cases.

- `TextInput` is **specific**. It defines the layout of the input field, and is meant to be used in the majority of cirucmstances. It also includes some bells and whistles that `TextField` does not. In essense, `TextInput` is a `TextField` with a specific layout & style.
- `TextField` is **generic**. It is meant to be used when you want to customize the presentation of a field, but still want to take advantage of the accessibility features of the `FieldInput`.

This usage of `TextInput`:

```jsx
<TextInput
  label="Label"
  message="Message"
  value="Error"
  value=""
  onChange={() => {}}
/>
```

is essentially equivalent to the following use of `TextField`:

```jsx
<TextField value="" onChange={() => {}}>
  <FieldLabel>Label</FieldLabel>
  <FieldMessage>Message</FieldMessage>
  <FieldInput />
  <FieldErrorMessage>Error</FieldErrorMessage>
</TextField>
```
