# Install

```
$ npm install --save atomic-elements
```

```
$ yarn add atomic-elements
```

# Usage

First, at the top level of you project, you'll want to import in the stylesheets.

This stylsheet includes all the styles for each component in the library.

```js
import "atomic-elements/dist/styles.css";
```

This stylesheet includes all the fonts used by the library. You can exclude these if you want to handle
importing these fonts yourself. The default configuration uses Lato, and material-icons

```js
import "atomic-elements/dist/fonts.css";
```

This stylesheet defines the CSS variables used by library. This includes all the colors used.

```js
import "atomic-elements/dist/variables.css";
```

You can then start importing components

Either from their specific files:

```js
import Button from "atomic-elements/components/Buttons/Button";
```

Or from the index, which exports all of the components

```js
import { Button } from "atomic-elements";
```

## Customizing Appearance

One of the goals with `atomic-elements` is to make it easily customizable. This is accomplished through CSS variables

Because atomic-elements uses regular CSS and classnames, it is easy to modify the styles by simply
adding your own CSS scoped to the particular class. For example, the [Button](?path=/docs/buttons-button--primary) component
has a class name of `aje-btn`. So you can simply add a new CSS declaration and target that classname to modify the appearance
of the buttons.
