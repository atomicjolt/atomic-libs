# Usage

First, at the top level of you project, you'll want to import in the stylesheets.

This stylesheet includes all the fonts used by the library. You can exclude these if you want to handle
importing these fonts yourself. The default configuration uses Lato, and material-icons

```js
import "atomic-elements/dist/fonts.css";
```

This stylesheet defines the CSS variables used by library. This includes all the colors used. You can customize this,
or bring your own for full customization

```js
import "atomic-elements/dist/variables.css";
```

Finally, there is an optional global stylesheet that sets some sensible defaults to make atomic-elements look its best, but
it shouldn't be necessary and you should be able to forgot this if need be

```js
import "atomic-elements/dist/global.css";
```

You can then start importing components

Either from their specific files:

```js
import Button from "atomic-elements/components/Buttons/Button";
```

Or from the index, which exports all of the components

```js
import { Button } from "atomic-elements";
```
