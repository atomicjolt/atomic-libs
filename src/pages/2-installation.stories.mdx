<Meta title="Installation" />

# Install

```
$ npm install --save @atomicjolt/atomic-elements
```

```
$ yarn add @atomicjolt/atomic-elements
```

## Setup

At the root of your application, you should include the following components:

```tsx
import { CssVariables } from "@atomicjolt/atomic-elements";

const App = () => (
  <>
    <CssVariables />
    <YourApp />
  </>
);
```

### CSS Variables

The `<CssVariables />` component will set the CSS variables used by the Atomic Elements. It is recommended that you use this component at the root of your application.
If you don't include this component none of the components will look correct (unless you provide defaults for everything yourself).

### Fonts

Atomic Elements makes use of the following Fonts

- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?query=lato) (Text Font)
- [Material Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons) (For the [`MaterialIcon`](/docs/atoms-materialicon--overview) component & any other components that make use of an icon)
- [Material Symbols](https://fonts.google.com/icons) (Only needed if you want to use the [`MaterialSybmol`](/docs/atoms-materialsymbol--overview) component)

For convenience, Atomic Elements provides a `<LoadFonts />` component that will load the fonts for you. You can use this component at the root of your application.

```tsx
import { LoadFonts } from "@atomicjolt/atomic-elements";

const App = () => (
  <>
    <LoadFonts />
    <YourApp />
  </>
);
```

**This is not recommended for production, but it is useful when starting a new project**

### CSS Global Defaults

Atomic Elements also provides a `<CssGlobalDefaults />` component will set some global CSS defaults.

### Sensible Defaults

The `<SensibleDefaults />` component bundles the three above component into a single component.

```tsx
import { SensibleDefaults } from "@atomicjolt/atomic-elements";

const App = () => (
  <>
    <SensibleDefaults />
    <YourApp />
  </>
);
```
