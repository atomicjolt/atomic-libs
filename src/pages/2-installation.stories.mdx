<Meta title="Installation & Usage" />

# Install

```
$ npm install --save atomic-elements
```

```
$ yarn add atomic-elements
```

# Usage

First, at the top level of you project, you'll want to import in the stylesheet.

```js
import "atomic-elements/dist/styles.css";
```

You can then start importing components

Either from their specific files:

```js
import Button from "atomic-elements/components/Buttons/Button";
```

Or from the index, which exports all of the components

```js
import { Button } from "atomic-elements";
```

## Customizing Appearance

Because atomic-elements uses regular CSS and classnames, it is easy to modify the styles by simply
adding your own CSS scoped to the particular class. For example, the [Button](?path=/docs/buttons-button--primary) component
has a class name of `aje-btn`. So you can simply add a new CSS declaration and target that classname to modify the appearance
of the buttons.

atomic-elements also defines a host of CSS variables that can be used to control things like colors globally you can see the defines
[here](https://github.com/atomicjolt/atomic-elements/blob/main/src/components/defines.scss)
