# Install

```
$ npm install --save @atomicjolt/atomic-elements
```

```
$ yarn add @atomicjolt/atomic-elements
```

## Setup

At the root of your application, you'll want to import some of these components:

```tsx
import {
  LoadFonts,
  CssVariables,
  CssGlobalDefaults,
} from "@atomicjolt/atomic-elements";

const App = () => (
  <>
    <LoadFonts />
    <CssVariables />
    <CssGlobalDefaults />
    <YourApp />
  </>
);
```

### Fonts

The `<LoadFonts />` component will load the fonts used by the Atomic Elements. This is not recommended for production, but it is useful for getting started
It is recommended that you use this component at the root of your application.

If you want to handle the fonts in a different way, you can forgo this component and load the fonts yourself. For example, loading them in your HTML file
from Google Fonts:

```html
<!-- Lato is the default text font, you should only need these variants.
You could load a different text-font if you wanted -->
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lato:wght@200;400;700&display=swap"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>

<!-- Material Icons -->
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>

<!-- The default is filled, you only need any of these if you actually intend to use them -->
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons%7CMaterial+Icons+Outlined"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons%7CMaterial+Icons+Round"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons%7CMaterial+Icons+Sharp"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons%7CMaterial+Icons+Two+Tone"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

#### Icons

If you're planning on using a Material Icon variant, you'll need to load the Material Icons font. You can do this with `<LoadFonts />` or you can load it yourself (like above):

```tsx
<LoadFonts fonts={["lato", "material-icons-outlined"]} />
```

### CSS Variables

The `<CssVariables />` component will set the CSS variables used by the Atomic Elements. It is recommended that you use this component at the root of your application.
If you don't include this component none of the components will look correct (unless you provide defaults for everything yourself).

### CSS Global Defaults

The `<CssGlobalDefaults />` component will set some global CSS defaults. It is recommended that you use this component at the root of your application. These are
common CSS defaults that will make Atomic Elements looks it's best. Not including this component will not break anything, but the components won't look like they do
in the storybook.

### Sensible Defaults

The `<SensibleDefaults />` component bundles the three above component into a single component.
It is recommended that you use this component at the root of your application.

```tsx
import { SensibleDefaults } from "@atomicjolt/atomic-elements";

const App = () => (
  <>
    <SensibleDefaults />
    <YourApp />
  </>
);
```
