# Modal Initilization

To begin using the modal components, you first need to intialize the modals. At the root of you application,
you need to add something like this:

```jsx
import { Modal } from "atomic-elements";

const root = document.getElementById("app-root");

Modal.init(root);

// Render your application
```

Where `root` is the insertion point for your React app.

Modal Initilization does two things:

- Creates a new element outside of your app root for the Modals to be rendered into
- Lets atomic-elements know where the root is, so it can mark it as hidden to screenreaders when a modal is open
