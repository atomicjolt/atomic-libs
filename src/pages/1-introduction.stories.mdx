# Introduction

Atomic Elements is a set of broadly-applicable React components for use within our applications.
This site serves as interactive documentation for all of the components, powered by [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

You can see all the components currently available on the left navigation. Some components have multiple stories, which characterize different
ways in which the component can be used.

## Goals

### Consistency

Each of our apps are going to need to use the same basic components (inputs, buttons, modals, etc...).
As a result, each of these apps have implementations for components for each of these purposes, all
with slightly different implementations and goals. @atomicjolt/atomic-elements aims to replace these common components with generalized alternatives that should
be workable in any situations. This should make transferring from application to application a smoother
process for developers.

Additionally, these docs will serve as a "single source of truth" for how to use each of these components
in any of the applications that they end up in.

### Efficiency

Since many components are replciated in several apps, some work has been doubled to produce that. Even if
the component was originally copied from one app to the other, if updates are required to be made
to the component, the hassle of updating it in multiple locations is a huge annoyance. By moving the
components into a library, the update needs to be made only once, then each app can pull in the
updated dependancy when needed.

### Accessiblity

@atomicjolt/atomic-elements aims to have _every_ one of it's components completly accessible, while also allowing
the developer using the components to not have to worry about ensuring accessiblity. Whenever the
component requires a property for accessiblity purposes, this will be documented in the component's docs.
