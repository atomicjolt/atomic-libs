# Event Handlers

Each component exposes relavent event handlers that you can use to interact with it. For example,
the `TextInput` component exposes an `onChange` handler, which is called whenever the value of the text input changes.


Atomic Element's event handlers work slighly differently to their React counterparts. When an event has a particular value
that is important to it, like the value of a text field on the `onChange` handler, that value will be passed as the first argument,
and the full event object as the second one.

So, for example:

```tsx
<TextInput value={value} onChange={(v, event) => setValue(v)} />
// Or, even shorter
<TextInput value={value} onChange={setValue} />
```
> Say goodbye to `event.target.value`!

You want to remain aware of this when you're interopting with other libraries, like `react-hook-form` or `formik`, as they
expect the event object to be passed as the first argument. In  [@atomicjolt/forms](https://github.com/atomicjolt/atomic-form) for example,
all of the on change handlers end up getting wrapped to let the library deal with the even object instead:

```tsx
const handleChange = (_v, event) => {
    onChange(event);
}
```
