# Controlled vs Uncontrolled

Some components (specifically, inputs) can be used in both a controlled and uncontrolled state.

```jsx
import { TextInput } from "@atomicjolt/atomic-elements";

<TextInput lable="Some Text Input" />; // Uncontrolled

<TextInput lable="Some Text Input" value={...} onChange={...}/>; // Controlled
```

Like with builtin React elements, it is **not reccomended** to swap any component from
a uncontrolled to a controlled state during render. The control of component should be
determined beforehand, and remain the same for the lifetime of the component.

Any component that can controlled / uncontrolled with have a story that highlights this fact.

- The controlled component's state cannot be modified by interacting with the element, but you can use the story's controls
  to modify them
- The uncontrolled component's state can me modified by interacting with them.
