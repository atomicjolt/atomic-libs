# CSS Variables

Each component's CSS is built using CSS variables. This allows you to easily modify the appearance of the components by simply overriding the CSS variables.
[You can look at the variables.css file for the full list](https://github.com/atomicjolt/atomic-elements/blob/main/src/styles/variables.ts). These
variables should allow you the easily modify components on an app-wide scale, or on a instance-by-instance basis. If you feel like something should expose
a CSS variable that doesn't currently, feel free to open up a PR with the change.
