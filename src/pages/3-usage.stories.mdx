# Usage

## Customizing Appearance

One of the goals with `atomic-elements` is to make it easily customizable. This is accomplished through CSS variables.
[You can look at the variables.css file for the full list](https://github.com/atomicjolt/atomic-elements/blob/main/src/defines/variables.scss). These
variables should allow you the easily modify components on an app-wide scale, or on a instance-by-instance basis. If you feel like something should expose
a CSS variable that doesn't currently, feel free to open up a PR with the change.

In the cases where the CSS variables don't cut it, atomic-elements adds easy to use class names to all components
For example, the [Button](?path=/docs/buttons-button--primary) component has a class name of `aje-btn`.
So you can simply add a new CSS declaration and target that classname to modify the appearance of the buttons.

## Variants

Some components in atomic-elements have what we call _variants_.
A variant is a prop you provide that modifies the presentation of a component. There are two kinds of variants:

- **Visual Variations** only modify the visual presentation for a component via CSS. These can be easily modified / additional ones may be added. d
- **Semantic Variations** modify the actual structure of a component's markup. These need to be added to the code explicitly. Only a few components currently have this kind of variant:
  - `TextInput`
  - `CustomSelect`
  - `ComboBox`

### Visual Variations

You can create these easily by passing in a new variant name to the component. The component will add a new classname to it's root that takes the form `aje-<classname>--<variant>`. For example, if you added a variant to the Button called "purple",
that instance of the component would have the classname `aje-btn--purple`. If you open up the developer tools and look at the buttons below, you can see what variant classnames have been applied to them:

<Canvas>
  <Button variant="primary">Primary</Button>
  <Button variant="secondary">Secondary</Button>
  <Button variant="success">Success!</Button>
  <Button variant="error">Error!</Button>
</Canvas>

### Semantic Variations

Semantic variants change the actual structure of the HTML, and as such, are implmented in the component specifically. For example, the "floating" variant
of the text input component moves the label _below_ the input rather than above it, you can see this by inspecting the following elements:

<Canvas>
  <TextInput variant="default" label="Default Variant" />
  <TextInput variant="floating" label="Floating Variant" />
</Canvas>
