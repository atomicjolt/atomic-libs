# Sub Components

---

The `Table` component comes with a suite of sub-components to defines the differents parts of a table's structure.
Some of these, are merely semantic sugar ontop of builtin JSX components, while others provide additional functionality.

## `<Table.Head />`

Defines the head of the table. Equivelant to `<thead />`

## `<Table.Header />`

Defines the individual headers of the table. The headers can be made [sortable](#sorting)

## `<Table.Body />`

Defines the body of the table. Equivelant to `<tbody />`

## `<Table.Row />`

Defines an individual Row of the table.

`Table.Row` may be used in two ways. If you don't need control over the individual cells you can use the `data` prop:

```jsx
<Table.Row data={[1, 2, 3, 4]} />
```

If more control is desired, `Table.Cell` may be passed as children instead.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="tables-table--custom-cells" />
</Canvas>

## `<Table.Cell />`

Defines an individual table cell. Equivelant to `<td />`

# Sorting

---

The Table optionally supports limited sorting functionality.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="tables-table--sortable-headers" />
</Canvas>

**NOTE**: You still must manage the actual sorting / arrangement of rows.
