There are three things that compose a tooltip:

1. The `Tooltip` component itself. This is the element that will be displayed when the target element is hovered over.
2. The `ToolTipTrigger` component. This component handles the logic of displaying the tooltip when the target element is hovered over.
3. The target component. This is a focusable element that will trigger the tooltip to be displayed when hovered over or foucsed on via keyboard navigation.

In the following example, the `Button` component is the target element:

<Canvas of={ToolTipStories.Primary} />

Note than when using `ToolTipTrigger`, it handles setting up the refs and event listeners for you. Any components in this library
that are "focusable" can be used out of the box as the target of a tooltip. So you can use `Button`, `TextInput`, etc. as the target.

<Canvas of={ToolTipStories.InputTarget} />

## Custom ToolTip target

If you need to use a custom component as the target of a tooltip, you can wrap your component with the `ToolTipTarget` component. Note that doing
this will add a new element to the DOM, so it is recommended to use this only when necessary. You can customize what element is actually rendered
by passing a `as` prop to `ToolTipTarget`.

<Canvas of={ToolTipStories.WithCustomTarget} />

<Canvas of={ToolTipStories.IconWithTooltip} />
